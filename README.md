# SimTKpf

This is my end-of-degree project, a C++ library for state estimation using particle filters and [Simbody](https://simtk.org/projects/simbody/), another library for multibody dynamics.

## How to use it

You will need to install Simbody first. Follow its [Github repository](https://github.com/simbody/simbody) installation steps. Then use the software mentioned there (acording to your OS) to generate and build **SimTKpf** project.
